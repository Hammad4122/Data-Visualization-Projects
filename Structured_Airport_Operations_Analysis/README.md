# ðŸ›« Airport Data Visualization Project

This project performs **data analysis and visualization** on airport operational datasets.  
It uses **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to explore and visualize different aspects of airport operations, including flight status, passenger trends, fuel consumption, baggage handling, and weather impact.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Data Loading**: Reads JSON files containing multiple datasets:
  - Flights
  - Passenger statistics
  - Baggage handling
  - Fuel consumption
  - Employee stats
  - Weather conditions
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes duplicate rows and resets indices.
- **Analysis Functions**:
  - Count on-time vs delayed flights.
  - Calculate average domestic & international passengers per day.
  - Compute total fuel cost per airline.
  - Correlate weather conditions with passenger numbers.
  - Compare fuel consumption to lost baggage.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Bar charts for flight status and baggage handling.
  - Line charts for passenger trends and fuel consumption.
  - scatterplots for deeper insights.
